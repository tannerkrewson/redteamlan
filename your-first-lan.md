## Your First LAN

Here's a short and sweet guide on how to prepare for your first LAN party attendance.

Before the LAN:

- **Your Computer**: Decide if you will bring a desktop or laptop. Most people bring their desktops, and I would recommend it if it is more powerful than your laptop. But a laptop also works perfectly fine.
- **Install Steam**: Most important thing you will ever do in your whole life. Your life will never be the same. Click [here](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) to ascend (and download Steam).
- **Install the required free games**: On the [Games](/games) page, which can be found at the top of this site, you will find some games you must download.
- **Figure out what snack you want to bring**: You must bring a snack or pack of soda for entry to a LAN. You may also opt to pay $5 instead of bringing a snack. This $5 is separate from the $5 for pizza. The best snacks to bring are Doritos, cookies, soda, etc. This will be shared with everyone.
- **Get administrator access**: If you are bringing your parent's/family's computer, you need the admin password to avoid issues with firewalls and such that may prevent you from being able to play some games.
- **Get lots of sleep the night before**: We always stay up late into the night. Caffeine only helps so much. Get some sleep and you'll be set.

Day of the LAN:

- **USE THE CHECKLIST**: Checklist is love, checklist is life. If you don't use the checklist, you will forget something. If you use it, you will be prepared for the LAN.

- **Packing up**: Pack up early because, especially with a desktop, it might take a bit longer then you might expect to pack all of your stuff.
- **Eat lunch**: Don't come hungry, because it will be a few hours before we order pizza.
- **Arrive on time**: It's okay to come late if you have something urgent to do, but try to get there on time. If you want to come earlier, just ask me.
- **Come on in**: Ring the doorbell, but if we're not responding, please walk right in. We are in the basement which is the white door on the right.
- **Sit by people you know**: It probably won't be very fun if you're surrounded by people you don't know, even if they're really nice (hint: they are).
- **Play the games**: Don't be that guy.
- **Have fun!**
