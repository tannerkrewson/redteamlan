## About

A message from the founder of Red Team LAN-
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Red Team LAN was created to bring friends back together in one place to catch up and play games together. It's been my honor to run over 20 LAN events and creating an enjoyable environment for all, serious gamers and non, to share. I've put hours of effort into making each and every LAN run as smoothly as possible with the hope that people will find something valuable to be had from the experience. I sincerely thank you for attending this LAN on behalf myself and everyone who has been apart of Red Team LAN since 2013."</blockquote>

#### What to bring:

( [Click Here for a Shortened, Printable Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y3UrP7L8gHSwFeqJHDsV3vuJ28vzJbHS7lOWkD7EUts/edit?usp=sharing) )

- **Your computer**:
    - Desktops and laptops are allowed. 
    - Remember your power cable/charger for your computer.
    - Desktops aren't as much as a hassle as you might think, so if its better than you're laptop, bring it.
    - If you're bringing a laptop, make sure you’re fully charged before you come
    - Your computer should be running Windows 7 or 8 to play all games.

- **Monitor**: This is so you can see your games... unless you prefer to use echo location to play games. If you have a better monitor than the screen on your laptop, you can bring that, but don't bring more than one monitor otherwise. You need two cables for this, the DVI/VGA cable and the power cable. And, for the love of god, please do not bring one of [these](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/08/lg-21-9-dsc08402.jpg).
- **Mouse**: Even if you have a laptop, you should bring a mouse because you will want to kill yourself if you use a trackpad to game. Make sure it has a laser, not a ball.
- **Mouse Pad**: Your mouse probably won't work that great on the tables, and some won't work at all on the plastic tables. A mouse pad will fix this.
- **Keyboard**: If you have a desktop this is obvious. Laptops have one built in that is (usually) good enough.
- **Speakers / Headset**: Bring your headset if you don't want to annoy everyone; bring your speakers if you do. If you do bring speakers, you hereby give everyone the right to throw them out the window if you are blasting Moon Man music.
- **Power Strip**: Even if you have a laptop, you should bring this. We never have enough; it's unavoidable.
- **Pillow/Sleeping Materials**: We have a limited, first-come first-serve supply of sleeping supplies. Bring your own to be sure you don't get left out.
- **Snacks**: A bag of chips, some cookies, donuts, candy, etc. Even a pack of soda would be good. Read the guidelines below to help determine if your snack is a good snack:
    - Get your snack(s) approved with your host first to make sure no one else is bringing the same thing.
    - Make sure you bring snacks that you think at least half of the guests will eat. Seems people like to eat foods that aren't as messy and greasy so they don't get it on their fancy computers.
    - Go ahead and take the food that you brought that we didn't finish home.
    - For example, at LAN Party 4, Kevin S brought a family size bag of Ruffles that was opened, but was not eaten by anyone at all, and that bag now lives in my pantry forever more.

- **Money**: If the LAN requires it, bring it, whatever the price maybe. If you think it's too much, we can fight irl.
- **Cellphone and its charger**: To call your mommy when Chris Hodges makes you cry. (watch out, he's a [real g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlpTnEjPEE).)
- **iPod, iPad, DS, etc. and the chargers**: For when you're bored of Team Fortress 2, because that is all we will end up playing anyways.
- **Game consoles**: Ask the event host first.

What NOT to bring:

- **Ethernet Cables**: will be provided
- **Brett's Mom**: provided since 2013 _and counting_
