**Visit the site: www.redteamlan.com**

This is the source code of the new website for Red Team LAN, replacing the old Google Sites website.

It was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/). It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Branding

With the new website brings a slight rebranding to the style introduced with the LAN 18 invite. Before, Red Team LAN's font-of-choice for the logo and all text on posters and invites was Microsoft's [Segoe UI Light](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1944). This is still true, with one exception. The logo font has been changed to Google's [Josefin Sans Light](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Josefin+Sans) to help the logo stand out from text that surrounds it in invites, posters, flyers, and the website itself.
