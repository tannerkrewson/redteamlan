## Lansite

Lansite is web app made by myself, Tanner Krewson, for smaller LAN parties. It is designed to be a simple, central information hub for all attendees.

**If you are at a LAN now, [click here to go to Lansite](http://lansite.redteamlan.com/).**

**If you want to learn about the code that powers Lansite, [click here to view the Github page](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/Lansite).**
